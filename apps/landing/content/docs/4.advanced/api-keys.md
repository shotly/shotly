## Overview

API keys provide a secure and controlled way to access Shotly's functionality for external applications and automation. With them, you can integrate third-party services, scripts, or tools without exposing your credentials. This is especially useful for automating routine tasks, creating custom integrations, or extending the platform's capabilities through external applications.

## Create API key

1. Go to the Shotly settings and select the **API keys** section.
2. In the "Create API key" block, enter a unique name for the new key â€” this will help distinguish keys from each other.
3. Specify the key expiration date (e.g., 1 day, 1 month, 12 months, or no expiration).
4. Click the **Create API key** button.
5. After creation, copy the generated key and save it in a secure place. For security reasons, the key will be displayed only once.

## Usage

API keys can be used for:
- Integration with external services and automation (e.g., automatically adding links through scripts);
- Getting statistics and managing collections through the API;
- Creating your own tools and extensions for Shotly.
