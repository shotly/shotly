## Monorepo Structure

Shotly uses a monorepo structure to manage multiple packages and applications. The main packages are:

- `apps/web`: The main Shotly application.
- `apps/landing`: The landing page for Shotly.
- `packages/db`: The Database models inside the monorepo.
- `specs`: OpenAPI specifications for the Shotly.

The monorepo is managed utilizing [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). With pnpm, it is possible to execute commands across all packages or target specific packages. Consequently, you will primarily operate from the root of the repository and execute commands such as `pnpm run dev:app` to initiate the Shotly application.

To set up the development environment for Shotly, follow these steps:

::steps
### Clone the Repository:

```sh [terminal]
git clone https://github.com/shotly/shotly.git && cd shotly
```

### Install Dependencies:

```sh [terminal]
pnpm install
```

### Prepare the Environment:

```sh [terminal]
node ./scripts/prepare.mjs
```

### Start the Development Server:

```sh [terminal]
pnpm run dev:web
```

## Spec-first Development

Shotly uses [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) specifications to define the API endpoints and their parameters. The specifications are located in the `specs` directory.

To generate the API routes/types/zod schemas, run the following command:

```sh [terminal]
make spec-generate-web # Generate the Web API
```

You don't need to think about where and how to write types/zod schemas, just use the specification and the specification will generate everything for you.
This takes a huge burden off your shoulders, allowing you to focus on developing functionality rather than generating code.

## Database

Shotly uses [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) to manage the database. The database models are located in the `packages/db` directory.
Drizzle is a modern database client for Node.js that provides a type-safe way to interact with database. As a data provider, we use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).

To generate the database models, run the following command:

```sh [terminal]
pnpm run db:generate # Generate the database models
```

To migrate the database, run the following command:

```sh [terminal]
pnpm run db:migrate # Migrate the database
```

To start the database studio, run the following command:

```sh [terminal]
pnpm run db:studio # Start the database studio
```

## UI Components

Shotly uses [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) to manage the UI.

- UI fom Web placed in the `apps/web/app/components` directory.
- UI fom Landing placed in the `apps/landing/app/components` directory.
