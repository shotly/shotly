#### Monorepo Structure

Shotly uses a monorepo structure to manage multiple packages and applications. The main packages are:

- `apps/web`: The main Shotly application.
- `apps/landing`: The landing page for Shotly.
- `packages/ui`: The shared UI components inside the monorepo.
- `packages/db`: The Database models inside the monorepo.

The monorepo is managed utilizing [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). With pnpm, it is possible to execute commands across all packages or target specific packages. Consequently, you will primarily operate from the root of the repository and execute commands such as `pnpm run dev:app` to initiate the Shotly application.

To set up the development environment for Shotly, follow these steps:

::steps
### Clone the Repository:

```sh [terminal]
git clone https://github.com/shotly/shotly.git && cd shotly
```

### Install Dependencies:

```sh [terminal]
pnpm install
```

### Prepare the Environment:

```sh [terminal]
