We provide a docker compose file to get you started quickly. It's a good way to get started with Shotly without having to install any dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- A [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installation
- A [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installation

## Quick deployment

::steps
### Create a new directory:

```sh [terminal]
mkdir shotly && cd shotly
```

### Download the docker compose file:

Download the docker compose file from the [Shotly repository](https://github.com/shotly/shotly/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml).

```sh [terminal]
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shotly/shotly/main/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

### Create a `.env` file:

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```dotenv [.env]
# app
APP_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/shotly
APP_SESSION_PASSWORD=RANDOM_32_CHARS

# postgres (optional if you want to use a different database)
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
```

You can learn more about environment variables in the [environment variables](./99.environment-variables.md) page.

### Start the services:

Start the service by running:

```sh [terminal]
docker compose up -d
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and you should be greeted with the Sign In page.
